### Image manquante

Going through my archives, I selected the negatives of photographs that didn’t come out. Labelled as failed by the photo laboratory, they were not printed. By scanning and enlarging them, I gave them an existence.

Project made during a workshop with [David De Beyter](http://www.daviddebeyter.com/)

21 x 29,7, 4 booklets of 16 images, laser printed, 2017
