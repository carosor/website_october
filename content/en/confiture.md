### Confiture

Confiture (which means “jam” in French) is a project for a periodical publication focusing on social, cultural and visual studies. It aims at analysing popular cultural practices in the present world and societies. 
Each issue is dedicated to a different question such as cultural legitimacy, digital communities or matters  of representation in pop culture.
The title refers to a French idiomatic expression basically saying that the less one knows, the more one brags about.

Texts were gathered from [openedition.org](http://www.openedition.org/).
