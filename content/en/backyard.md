### Not in my backyard

In 2013, an abandoned train station in a wealthy neighborhood of Paris is about to be replaced by a block of council flats despite the loud opposition of its neighbors. A few weeks before the works begin, I went there to immortalize this urban wasteland, symbol of the class war in the 16th arrondissement.

20 x 28 cm, 16 pages, digital print, saddle stitch binding, 2013
